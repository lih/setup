Contributing to Setup.shl
========================

Contributions are always welcome, be it in the form of new ideas, or
new modules to extend the basic feature set.

Reporting bugs
--------------

You can report the bugs that you find by opening an issue on [this
project's GitHub page](https://github.com/lih/setup.git).

Creating new modules
--------------------

If you think a language or ecosystem deserves its own module, you are
probably right. In that case, you can simply open a pull request with
your new module file in `lib/setup.d`.

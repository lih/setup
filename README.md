Setup: A simple Bash library to replace Makefiles
=================================================

`make` (and similar dependency-chasing tools) offer very useful
primitives for building complex file hierarchies from a small set of
source files, while minimizing the amount of work needed to rebuild
after a small change.

Setup tries to offer the same basic set of features, in a Bash
environment.

Install and first use
---------------

Since it's basically just a Bash script, you can start using Setup
from your shell by simply sourcing the `lib/setup.shl` file.

This file defines two functions, `prepare` and `setup`, whose job it
is to respectively prepare computations and run them.

### The `prepare` function

Usage: **prepare FILE... = COMMAND (-OPT|@FILE|FILE)...**

This function declares that the FILEs on the left of the `=` are the
result of the application of the COMMAND to its arguments. It does
*not* itself run the command.

An argument can take three shapes :

  - starting with a `-` indicates a *flag argument*, which doesn't need to describe a file
  - starting with a `@` indicates a *splice dependency*, which is described in more detail [here|#why_not_use_make]
  - otherwise, it is a simple dependency

### The `setup` function

Usage: **setup FILE...**

This function computes all the files that have been prepared before
it, in addition to the FILEs passed as  arguments. 

### Automatic targets

Other build tools usually provide a sort of "wildcard target" to avoid repetition, as in :

    %.o: %.c
    	 ...

Setup is no exception, even if it doesn't provide nice syntactic sugar
for those rules. Instead, you can declare your own callbacks to prepare
files at the last minute. For example, the following code would
be equivalent to the above rule :

    function C.auto_o() {
        case "$1" in
            *.o) prepare "$1" = GCC-c "${1/%.o/.c}";;
            *) return 1;;
        esac
    }
    Setup.addHooks C.auto_o

It doesn't look as pretty, but it is a much more powerful way to
describe automatic dependencies, as it allows the full power of Bash
to be brought forth to take advantage of contextual information.

For more example of automatic dependencies, visit the `lib/setup.d`
directory.

Why not use Make ?
------------------

The complexities of some build processes are not accurately captured
by the dependency model of Make-like tools. As an example, consider
the following example :

file: test.c

:       #include "test.h"
    
        int main() { printf("%d\n",f()); }

file: test.h

:       #include "A.h"

        A_type f(void);

file: A.h

:       typedef int A_type;

file: Makefile

:       test.o: test.c ???
        	gcc -c $< -o $@

In this example, Make offers no simple way for `test.o` to know that
it depends on `A.h`, or even `test.h` if `test.c` doesn't exist a
priori. We would like to be able to express the dependency as
"`test.o` depends on `test.c` and _all the includes of `test.c`_', but
our tools don't permit that last part.

With Setup, these dependencies can be simply expressed as : 

    prepare "$file.includes" = Includes "$file.c"
    prepare "$file.o" = GCC-c "$file.c" @"$file.includes"

The `@` in front of the last dependency denotes a *splice dependency*,
which indicates that, in order to compute `"$file.o"`, we first need
to compute a list of include names in `"$file.includes"`, then splice
that list and use each component as a dependency.

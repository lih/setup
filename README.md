Setup.shl: A simple Bash library to replace Makefiles
=================================================

`make` (and similar dependency-chasing tools) offer very useful
primitives for building complex file hierarchies from a small set of
source files, while minimizing the amount of work needed to rebuild
after a small change.

Setup.shl tries to offer the same basic set of features, in a Bash
environment. It supports parallel compilation, and transitive
dependencies. Other than that, it tries to be as easy to learn as
possible.

Installing and using Setup.shl
--------------------------

Since it's basically just a Bash script, you can start using Setup.shl
from your shell by simply setting the `SETUP_INSTALL_DIR` variable to
the root of this project, and sourcing the
[lib/setup.shl](lib/setup.shl) file (if you are using Bash, that is).

This file defines two functions, `prepare` and `setup`, whose job it
is to respectively prepare computations and run them.

There is also a [bin/setup](bin/setup) executable that performs a job
similar to the `make` tool : it searches a file named `Setup` in the
current directory or its parents, and runs that file in an environment
where the setup library was already sourced.

This project provides a Setup file to illustrate its own
usage. Installing Setup.shl can be done by running
[bin/setup](bin/setup) and installing the resulting archive (called
`.pkg.tar.gz`) to the root of your filesystem :

    SETUP_INSTALL_DIR="$PWD" bin/setup package
    sudo tar -xzf .pkg.tar.gz -C /

### The `prepare` function

Usage: **prepare FILE... = COMMAND (-OPT|@FILE|FILE)...**

This function declares that the FILEs on the left of the `=` are the
result of the application of the COMMAND to its arguments. It does
*not* itself run the command.

An argument can take three shapes :

  - starting with a `-` indicates a *flag argument*, which doesn't
    need to describe a file
  - starting with a `@` indicates a *splice dependency*, which is
    described in more detail [here](#splice-dependencies)
  - otherwise, it is a simple dependency that triggers the command
    when it becomes newer than any of the FILEs

### The `setup` function

Usage: **setup FILE...**

This function computes all the files that have been prepared before
it, in addition to the FILEs passed as  arguments. 

Like `make`, `setup` uses timestamps to avoid wastefully recompiling
when a file is already more recent than its dependencies.

### Other useful functions and variables

Alongside those two main functions, Setup.shl also allows minor
configurations to take place, by using the following functions and
variables :

  - the `SETUP_JOBS` variable can be set at any point in the script to
    the desired number of parallel jobs to run (default: 8) on the
    next call to `setup`

  - the `Setup.params PARAM...` function prints the value of the first
    PARAM that was specified on the command-line, if it exists. If
    that PARAM starts with `-`, it is not printed out. The function
    exits non-zero if none of the PARAMs were specified on the
    command-line. As such it can be used to define build flags, like
    so :
    
        if Setup.params -install; then
           ...
        fi
        
    Coupled with an assignment, it can also retrieve a parameter's
    value in a variable :

        if target="$(Setup.params target)"; then
            # The 'target' param was specified, and is now in the 'target' variable
            ...
        fi

    These flag can then be triggered by running the commands `setup
    install` or `setup target=TARGET` (or `setup install
    target=TARGET` for both).

  - the `Setup.use MODULE...` function loads modules from the
    `$SETUP_INSTALL_DIR/lib/setup.d/MODULE.shl` files. It's basically
    a wrapper around `source`.

    After loading a module, it also tries to sources a local module
    file from `.setup/lib/MODULE.shl` if it exists, allowing you to
    override some module-specific functions if you need to.

  - the `Setup.load SETUP_FILE PARAM...` function loads another Setup
    file in the current context, in order to use its preparations as
    dependencies further down the line.

    Each PARAM can be what you would specify on the command-line for a
    standalone invocation, such as `install` or `target=X` (see the
    `Setup.params` function for more information), and is made
    available alongside the PARAMs of the current context, overriding
    them when a conflict arises.
    
  - the `Setup.hook FUNCTION...` can be used to define new automatic
    dependency generators.

    A generator is a function which take a single file name as
    argument, and should prepare this file if it knows how. Otherwise,
    it should return non-zero to signal to try the next generator.

  - the `Setup.state-file NAME` function specifies an optional state
    file, which is used by Setup.shl to remember information from one
    build to the next and speed up dependency resolution upon
    successive invocations of `setup`.

    This file is created automatically by Setup.shl and can safely be
    deleted if it causes problems (it shouldn't but there are always
    exceptions).

    Warning: the `prepare` function doesn't do anything if a file is
    already known to the build system. When using a state file, that
    means that once a file is specified, you can no longer change the
    command it is associated with, or its arguments (splice arguments
    are still recomputed correctly, don't worry), even in subsequent
    builds. If that happens, simply delete the state file, and restart
    the build to acknowledge the new dependency graph.

### Automatic targets via dependency hooks

Other build tools usually provide a sort of "wildcard target" to avoid
repetition, as in :

    %.o: %.c
         ...

Setup.shl is no exception, even if it doesn't provide nice syntactic sugar
for those rules. Instead, you can declare your own callbacks to prepare
files at the last minute. For example, the following code would
be equivalent to the above rule :

    function C.auto_o() {
        case "$1" in
            *.o) prepare "$1" = GCC-c "${1/%.o/.c}";;
            *) return 1;;
        esac
    }
    Setup.hook C.auto_o

It doesn't look as pretty, but it is a much more powerful way to
describe automatic dependencies, as it allows the full power of Bash
to be brought forth to take advantage of contextual information.

[lib/setup.d](lib/setup.d) directory.

### Splice dependencies for a more expressive build process

The complexities of some build processes are not accurately captured
by the dependency model of Make-like tools. As an example, consider
the following example :

file: test.c

    #include "test.h"

    int main() { printf("%d\n",f()); }

file: test.h

    #include "A.h"

    A_type f(void);

file: A.h

    typedef int A_type;

file: Makefile

    test.o: test.c ???
        gcc -c $< -o $@

In this example, Make offers no simple way for `test.o` to know that
it depends on `A.h`, or even `test.h` if `test.c` doesn't exist a
priori. We would like to be able to express the dependency as
"`test.o` depends on `test.c` and _all the includes of `test.c`_', but
our tools don't allow us to express that last part.

Using Setup.shl, these dependencies can be simply expressed as : 

    prepare "$file.includes" = Includes "$file.c"
    prepare "$file.o" = GCC-c "$file.c" @"$file.includes"

The `@` in front of the last dependency denotes a *splice dependency*,
which indicates that, in order to compute `"$file.o"`, we first need
to compute a list of include names in `"$file.includes"`, then splice
that list and use each element as a dependency. 

### Nested builds

Suppose you have two projects, A and B, such that A needs a part of B
to do its job (imagine that B can produce a certain library, which A
needs). B doesn't need A to function, so it provides its own
independent build script as a way to define its setup. Ideally, A
would be able to load B's build script, and add its own rules before
running a full-blown build operation with all the information it
needs, without any changes to B whatsoever.

Setup.shl allows this workflow by providing a function, `Setup.load`,
which -- as the name implies -- loads a nested Setup script from a
parent context in order to use its productions later on.

As a motivating example, consider a two-phase build of a C program :
one phase builds the binaries and libraries, and the second phase
builds a distribution package from those artifacts. 

file: C_proj/Setup

    #!/usr/bin/setup
    Setup.use C
    prepare main = C.ld main.o

file: Setup

    #!/usr/bin/setup
    Setup.use Pkg
    Setup.load C_proj/Setup
    
    Pkg.package Pkg.files usr/bin/main=C_proj/main

From this setup, any update to a C source file in `C_proj` will be
detected by the packaging script, and cause the necesary compilation
steps to be taken before rebuilding the affected packages.
